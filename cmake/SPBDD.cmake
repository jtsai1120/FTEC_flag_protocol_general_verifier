# and keep the first configure free of anything but a compiler. The difference
# is CUDD, which unlike BuDDy really does need its autotools build -- config.h
# carries a few dozen probed macros rather than three version numbers, so
# generating it by hand is not the small job it was there. cmake/build_cudd.sh
# runs that build and explains the one non-obvious step in it.
#
# SPBDD comes from the submodule at external/SPBDD, which pins the exact
# commit this repository was tested against. Set FTEC_SPBDD_SOURCE_DIR /
# FTEC_CUDD_SOURCE_DIR to build from a checkout you already have instead
# (useful offline, or when iterating on SPBDD itself).
